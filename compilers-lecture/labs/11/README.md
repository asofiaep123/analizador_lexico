# CFG implemented in Lex and YACC


Lex and yacc help you write programs that transform structured input. This includes
an enormous range of applications—anything from a simple text search program that
looks for patterns in its input file to a C compiler that transforms a source program into
optimized object code.

One of those applications are the context-free grammars (CFG). CFG are a more
powerful method of describing languages. Such grammars can describe certain
features that have a recursive structure, which makes them useful in a variety
of applications.

## Activities

Please create a compiler for the Advance Calculator programing language: 

Types In ac, there are only two data types: 
    Integer: a sequence of decimal numerals
    Float : five fractional digits after the decimal point

Keywords In ac, there are three reserved keywords, each limited for simplicity
to a single letter: 
    f (declares a float variable)
    i (declares an integer variable)
    p (prints the value of a variable).

Variables The ac language offers only 23 possible variable names, drawn from
the lowercase Roman alphabet and excluding the three reserved keywords f, i,
and p. Variables must be declared prior to using them.
